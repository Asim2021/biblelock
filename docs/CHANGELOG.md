# Project Changelog & Verified Outcomes

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- **Root Layout Navigation Crash (`DEC-003`):** Removed conditional `<View>` in `src/app/_layout.tsx` that broke Expo Router's navigator tree during initial session loading.
- **Route Collision:** Removed colliding `src/app/index.tsx` so that `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` is the sole canonical root route (`/`).
- **Safe Area Context:** Replaced legacy NativeWind `styled(RN)` in `src/components/SafeAreaView.tsx` with standard export from `react-native-safe-area-context`.
- **Typings:** Added `frontend/expo-env.d.ts` for global CSS module imports.

### Verified Impact
- Metro Bundler compiles 2,320 modules cleanly with HTTP 200 OK.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passing with 0 errors.
