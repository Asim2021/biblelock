# Project Changelog & Verified Outcomes

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- **Brandkit Splash & App Icons (`TASK-012`):** Generated minimalist warm-editorial brandmark combining the open Scripture book, cross, and subtle keyhole unlock metaphor on `#181715` canvas. Created `frontend/assets/images/splash-icon.png`, `frontend/assets/images/icon.png`, and `frontend/assets/images/favicon.png`.
- **Asset Typings:** Added `frontend/src/types/declarations.d.ts` declaring `.css`, `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.svg` modules for TypeScript strict typechecking.

### Verified Impact
- `npx expo prebuild --clean --no-install` resolves without ENOENT errors.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with 0 errors.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- **Root Layout Navigation Crash (`DEC-003`):** Removed conditional `<View>` in `src/app/_layout.tsx` that broke Expo Router's navigator tree during initial session loading.
- **Route Collision:** Removed colliding `src/app/index.tsx` so that `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` is the sole canonical root route (`/`).
- **Safe Area Context:** Replaced legacy NativeWind `styled(RN)` in `src/components/SafeAreaView.tsx` with standard export from `react-native-safe-area-context`.
- **Typings:** Added `frontend/expo-env.d.ts` for global CSS module imports.

### Verified Impact
- Metro Bundler compiles 2,320 modules cleanly with HTTP 200 OK.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passing with 0 errors.
